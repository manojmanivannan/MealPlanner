### üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure Components

#### GCP Services Utilized
1. **Cloud Run**: Serverless container platform for backend and frontend
2. **Cloud SQL**: Managed PostgreSQL database with automated backups
3. **Secret Manager**: Secure storage for database credentials and API keys
4. **Artifact Registry**: Docker image repository with vulnerability scanning
5. **Cloud Storage**: Terraform state backend (optional)
6. **Billing Budgets**: Cost monitoring with automated alerts
7. **IAM**: Workload identity and service account management

#### Resource Specifications
- **Backend**: Cloud Run with 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 0-10 instances

- **Database**: Cloud SQL db-f1-micro with 10GB SSD, auto-resize enabled
- **Budget**: $30 monthly limit with multi-threshold alerts

### üìã Deployment Requirements

#### Prerequisites
- Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled
- GitHub repository with admin access
- Terraform >= 1.0
- gcloud CLI
- Docker (optional, for local testing)

#### Required Secrets

   - Run initial Terraform deployment

2. **First Deployment**:
   - Push to main branch to trigger CI/CD pipeline
   - Verify service URLs and health checks
   - Test application functionality

3. **Ongoing Operations**:
   - Monitor costs via GCP Billing Console
   - Check application logs in Cloud Run
   - Update secrets and configurations as needed

### üîç Breaking Changes
